# Zombie ReactJS Test

This is a very basic NodeJS Express app where I am trying to test pages unsing [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Zombie](http://zombie.js.org/).

If I put in the home page the [helloworld example](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html) from ReactJS documentation, the tests fail due to timeout error.
